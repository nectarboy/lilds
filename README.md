# Building
You can either build directly in Visual Studio 2022 or configure it to use CMake.

If using CMake, configure it, then build by running
```
cmake --build x64/Debug
```

Included is also an example Sublime Text build system if you want to use that too. Just make sure to replace the "working_dir" path.
