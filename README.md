# My Goal
My goal for this project is emulate the DS accurately and also get more comfortable with C++.

I was previously working on a GBA emulator. It at least managed to get some titles like Kirby booting but I got frustrated and bored.

# Long-term Roadmap
- [ ] Get test programs running
- [ ] Get games running
- [ ] Get firmware running
- [ ] Implement most features
- [ ] Pass some accuracy tests
- [ ] Emulate DSi ?
- [ ] Optimize everything

# Building
You can either build directly in Visual Studio 2022 or configure it to use CMake.

If using CMake, configure it, then build by running
```
cmake --build x64/Debug
```

Included in `docs/` is also an example Sublime Text project file if you want to use that too.
